Community currency management for Odoo

**Work In Progress**: This repository will contain the necessary modules to integrate a [community currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_currency) in your [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) ERP system.

The first goal of this project is to provide the required features for the future cooperative food shop [Super Coop Manresa](https://supercoopmanresa.cat/) to be able to use the currency from [Ecoxarxa del Bages](https://ecoxarxadelbages.org) hosted at [IntegralCES](https://integralces.net). The development should be done in a sufficiently modularized way so it is also useful for other organizations and community currencies.
